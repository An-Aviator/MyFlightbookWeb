BUG: SFAR 73 - flight review is 12 months unless you have 200hrs of helicopter time.  should fix that.

Badges:
 - Need to integrate with email, somehow.  Nightly computation for anybody who has edited a flight during the day?	
 - Is using an airportlist inefficient (vs. using a direct DB query to get the airports?)  eliminates hashtable, other overhead, also would remove dupes from the list of airports to match
 - Badge for earning endorsements (digitally) - tailwheel, high perf, retract, badge for cross-country flight (first solo XC flight? First night XC flight?), first retractflight?
 - Badges for subsets within a state (e.g., South Carolina, Arkansas, California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia have these)
 
Feature requests:
 - (Jesse Tait) - Encrypt flight option for military?  Idea for implementation: you provide an encryption key, and the flight's route, comments, and actual aircraft get encrypted (aircraft mapped to anonymous), store results in comments (base64).  Provide key to decrypt, which restores these values.  That way, totals/currency are OK, but no details in the clear.
 - (Various at https://www.pilotsofamerica.com/community/threads/can-myflightbook-generate-canned-comments.102198/#post-2255259) - Canned comments for aircraft (always add a particular comment to a flight in a given aircraft)
 - (Paul Sergeant): Friend other pilots.  I.e., enable them to view your logbook, but not sign or make other changes.
 - (Danny Putland <danny.putland@gmail.com>) - any way to see if you've ever violated 61.195(a) (8 hours instruction in 24)?  Or, conversely, prove you haven't?
 - (Jonathan Schlegel <jschlege@vt.edu>) - CFI sport ratings progress
 - (Todd Dafforn <tdafforn@cox.net>, Max Wasser) - 61.55 (SIC proficiency) https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/61.55
 - (Tom Dolan <tom.dolan@aboveitall-uas-services.com>) - pressurized as a model attribute
 - (Hans Hovde <hhovde@yahoo.com>) - Aircraft operational cost calculator: put in fuel/oil prices, TBO and engine cost, fuel/oil consumption, hours flown/month and fixed costs (insurance/hangar/fees) and compute an operational cost/hour.
 - (Eerik Kiskonen <eerik.kiskonen@tietokeskus.com>, ekendall@aol.com) - default to share all flights, and a live signature with totals (e.g., for use on pilot forums)
TODO: boolean (AND/OR/NOT terms) in search, or specify whole word (so that "Rob" doesn't pick up "grob" or "aerobatic")
 - (Carsten Stracke) - AND/OR custom currencies.
 - (Rick Griffen) - add comments to airports (hotel suggestions, comments on FBOs, etc.)
 - (Daniel Wu) - 2-factor authentication?  Using Google Authenticator?
 
 CLUB NOTES/TODO:
  - add way to email whole club (admin-only)
  - Month view?
  - Schedule instructors with a flight?  Designate an instructor role and send a meeting request?
