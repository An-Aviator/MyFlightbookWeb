    %APP_NAME% can import flights, whether from a spreadsheet that you create or as an export from other logbook programs.  But regardless of the source,
    it must be in the form of a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values' target='_blank\'>CSV</a> (spreadsheet) file.
</p>
<p>
    The first row of the table (spreadsheet) must be the set of headers that identify which column is which; each subsequent row of the spreadsheet represents
    a flight that you&apos;d like to import.
</p>    
<p>
    If you&apos;re importing data that you've exported from another commercial logbook program, you may be able to import it directly; %APP_NAME% can translate
    the CSV exports from a number of commonly used logbook programs, including ForeFlight, LogTen Pro, Zululog, CrewTrac, CrewLog, and ELogSite.

<p>
    You will have a chance to preview the flights and see any potential errors before anything is imported.
