Dear {0}

You just created a new aircraft "{1}" on %APP_NAME%, and identified this aircraft with the following model:

     {2}

However, this aircraft was already identified by other pilots as being this model:

     {3}

Because this aircraft is already being used in flights by other pilots, %APP_NAME% assumes
the pre-existing model to be correct.
{4}
Sometimes, aircraft identifiers are reused.  Please contact us (use the "Contact Us" 
link at http://%APP_URL%) and we can ensure that you can get the definition correct for you.

If you believe that the model you specified is correct, you can update it at http://%APP_URL%, under
the "Aircraft" section.  If you update the aircraft there, it will update for all of the pilots who have
flown that aircraft.

Thank-you,

The %APP_NAME% Team
